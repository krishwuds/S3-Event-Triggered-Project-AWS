# S3-Event-Triggered-Project-AWS

## Overview

This project showcases a powerful and flexible setup for leveraging AWS S3 bucket events to trigger actions and workflows within the AWS ecosystem. Whether you need to process uploaded files, trigger notifications, or initiate custom processes when data is added to an S3 bucket, this project provides a robust foundation to get you started.

## Architecture

Our project architecture consists of the following key components:

- **S3 Buckets**: We use AWS S3 buckets to store and manage data. Events within these buckets trigger actions in response to uploads, deletions, or other changes.

- **AWS Lambda Functions**: AWS Lambda functions are utilized to perform serverless compute tasks in response to S3 events. They are highly customizable and can execute code in various programming languages.

- **IAM Roles**: We configure AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to grant the necessary permissions to our Lambda functions and other AWS resources.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and deploy the project:

### Prerequisites

- An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
- AWS CLI installed and configured with necessary credentials.
- [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/) installed globally (`npm install -g serverless`).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/s3-event-trigger-project.git
   cd s3-event-trigger-project

Usage

Once the project is deployed, you can use it to:

Automatically process files uploaded to specific S3 buckets.

Trigger notifications or alerts based on S3 events.

Customize Lambda functions to execute specific tasks when events occur.
